\# AI Hero



This project, developed as part of a 7-day course, builds a conversational agent that can answer questions about GitHub repository documentation. This repository showcases my learning journey and code.

\### Day 1: Ingest and Index Your Data



\*\*Objective:\*\* On Day 1, my primary goal was to set up the project environment and build a data ingestion pipeline to process documentation from a chosen GitHub repository.



\*\*What I Learned \& Accomplished:\*\*



\* \*\*Project Setup:\*\* I successfully initialized my personal Git repository (`aihero`) and structured it with dedicated `course` and `project` folders as per the curriculum.

\* \*\*Data Ingestion:\*\* I developed a Python function to download documentation from the \*\*`microsoft/autogen`\*\* repository. I learned the course's recommended method of processing data from a zip archive directly in memory, avoiding the need for a full `git clone`.

\* \*\*Data Parsing:\*\* I gained practical experience using the `python-frontmatter` library to parse Markdown documents, extracting structured metadata and the main content.

\* \*\*Git Mastery:\*\* I debugged a key issue with nested Git repositories, solidifying my understanding of core Git commands like `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git branch -M`. I now have a clean, working repository for my project.



\*\*Next Steps:\*\* Tomorrow, I will be learning about chunking large documents to improve search relevance and prepare the data for our AI agent.
