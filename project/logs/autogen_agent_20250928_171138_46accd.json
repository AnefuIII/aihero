This page details some best practices so that your extension package  integrates well with the AutoGen ecosystem.\n\n## Best practices\n\n### Naming\n\nThere is no requirement about naming. But prefixing the package name with `autogen-` makes it easier to find.\n\n### Common interfaces\n\nWhenever possible, extensions should implement the provided interfaces from the `autogen_core` package. This will allow for a more consistent experience for users.\n\n#### Dependency on AutoGen\n\nTo ensure that the extension works with the version of AutoGen that it was designed for, it is recommended to specify the version of AutoGen the dependency section of the `pyproject.toml` with adequate constraints.\n\n```toml\n[project]\n# ...\ndependencies = [\n    \"autogen-core>=0.4,<0.5\"\n]\n```\n\n### Usage of typing\n\nAutoGen embraces the use of type hints to provide a better development experience. Extensions should use type hints whenever possible.\n\n## Discovery\n\nTo make it easier for users to find your extension, sample, service or package, you can [add the topic](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) [`autogen`](https://github.com/topics/autogen) to the GitHub repo.\n\nMore specific topics are also available:\n\n- [`autogen-extension`](https://github.com/topics/autogen-extension) for extensions\n- [`autogen-sample`](https://github.com/topics/autogen-sample) for samples\n\n## Changes from 0.2\n\nIn AutoGen 0.2 it was common to merge 3rd party extensions and examples into the main repo. We are super appreciative of all of the users who have contributed to the ecosystem notebooks, modules and pages in 0.2. However, in general we are moving away from this model to allow for more flexibility and to reduce maintenance burden.\n\nThere is the `auto"

This ensures that you are working with the latest features, improvements, and security patches.\n\nIn the context of AutoGen, you might want to specify the version of AutoGen in your dependency management files (like `pyproject.toml` for Python) to ensure compatibility. For example:\n\n```toml\n[project]\n# ...\ndependencies = [\n    \"autogen-core>=0.4,<0.5\"\n]\n```\n\nThis kind of version specification helps ensure that your extensions and applications integrate properly with the version of AutoGen you are using.
